# FandangoMovieRating
Oct 2015, data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie rating data in Fandango and published an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/">article</a>.He found the strong evidence the ratings system was biased. Fandango Displays ratings from 0 to 5. Hickey found that there is discrepancy between the number of stars displayed and the actual rating. He was able to find out:
The actual rating was almost rounded up to the nearest half star. A movie with rating 4.1 would be rounded off to 4.5 instead of 4.
we will be working with the two samples of data. one sample was collected before the Hickey analysis and other one after the Hickey analysis. Data can be found <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango">here</a>.
With this research goal we have two population of intersets:
 1. All Fandango's rating for popular movies for year 2015.
 2. All Fandango's ratings for popular movies for year 2016.</br>
Popular movies in the sense if the movie has 30 or more than 30 fan ratings.
