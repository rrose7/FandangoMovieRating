# FandangoMovieRating
Oct 2015, data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie rating data in Fandango and published an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/">article</a>.He found the strong evidence the ratings system was biased. Fandango Displays ratings from 0 to 5. Hickey found that there is discrepancy between the number of stars displayed and the actual rating. He was able to find out:
The actual rating was almost rounded up to the nearest half star. A movie with rating 4.1 would be rounded off to 4.5 instead of 4.
we will be working with the two samples of data. one sample was collected before the Hickey analysis and other one after the Hickey analysis. Data can be found <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango">here</a>.
